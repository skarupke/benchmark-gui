I want to open-source this. The main annoyance is that I have one executable that has all the benchmarks and visualization and running of benchmarks in it. I think I can at least split this into two executables:

1. Load the DB, visualize the data, show the UI
2. Run the benchmarks

This separation might be easy because I already run benchmarks in a separate process. (except in profile-mode...)

When we have that, we can also just have multiple executables, each of which contains different benchmarks. One for sorting, one for hash tables etc. That should help a lot with build times.

For that to work the executable has to be able to advertise which benchmarks it contains. Shouldn't be too hard to add a command-line flag for that.

I probably want three ways to run the benchmark program:
1. Ask which benchmarks are available
2. Run a single benchmark
3. Run a single benchmark on repeat (new version of profile-mode)


Plan:
1. Write these command-line options
2. Support drag+drop for pulling in an executable to run benchmarks from.
 - repeated drag+drop will reload the available benchmarks
 - on conflicting benchmarks just refuse to load the whole thing and give an error
3. Pull all the existing benchmarks out into separate executables
4. Remove some of those separate executables from this project.
